      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD candidate at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Check out my research page for details about my current work.
I moved to Australia from the UK in 2018, and endeavour to spend my weekends exploring this vast, beautiful country. Some photographs of places I&amp;rsquo;ve recently discovered here can be found on my exploring page.
My work benefits from combining creative and analytic processes, a pairing that I first strengthened through still-life drawing. I still enjoy drawing and try to practice when I have a spare afternoon. See my drawing page for a small gallery of various sketches.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to speak to me, please get in touch!</description>
